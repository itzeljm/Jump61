clear        	Abandons the current game (if one is in progress), and clears the board to its initial configuration (all squares neutral with one spot). Playing stops until 
		the next start command.

start        Start playing from current position, if not doing so already (has no effect if currently playing).

quit         Exits the program.

auto P       Stops the current game until the next start command and causes player P to be played by an automated player (an AI) on subsequent moves. The value P must be "red" 		or"blue" (case-insensitive) Initially, Blue is an automated player.

manual P     Stops the current game until the next start command and causes player P to take moves from the terminal on subsequent moves. The value of P 
		is as for the auto command. Initially, Red is a manual player.

size N       Stops any current game, clears the board to its initial configuration, and sets the size of the board to N squares, where 2 d N d 10. Initially, N = 6.

move N       Stop any current game, set the number of the next move to N.Initially, the number of the next move is 1.

set R C N P  Stop any current game. Put N spots at row R and column C . P is either 'b'or 'r' (for blue or red,) indicating the color of the square. When N is 0, P 
		is ignored and the square is cleared. N must be non-negative and less than or equal to the number of neighboring squares.

dump         Print the board in its standard format. For example:
					===
					2r 1- 2r 3r 2b 2b
					1- 1- 3r 1r 4r 2b
					2r 2r 2r 3r 3r 3b
					2r 1- 3r 2r 1r 2r
					1- 3r 1- 2r 3r 3b
					2b 1- 2b 2b 2b 1b
					===
			
seed N       Seed the random number generated to N for automated players and for random board generation.
